## Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
**Priority: HIGH**

1. Create GitHub repository
2. Push code to GitHub
3. Connect to Vercel
4. Deploy and test

**See**: `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions

## Known Limitations

1. **Speed Tests Are Simulated**
   - Download and upload tests show realistic animations but don't measure actual speeds
   - Can be replaced with real tests later if needed
   - Infrastructure (serverless functions) is ready for real tests

2. **History Stored Locally**
   - Test history only in localStorage (client-side)
   - Cleared when browser data is cleared
   - No cross-device sync
   - Can add database later if needed

3. **No User Accounts**
   - Anonymous usage only
   - No login/registration
   - No personalization
   - Can add authentication later

4. **Basic Analytics**
   - No built-in analytics yet
   - Should add Google Analytics after deployment
   - Vercel Analytics available (paid)
