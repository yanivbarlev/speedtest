        <h1>Why Your Internet Slows Down Every Evening (And What You Can Actually Do About It)</h1>
        <div class="blog-meta">December 18, 2024 • 4 min read</div>

        <p>Does your internet feel lightning fast at noon but crawl to a halt by 8 PM? You're not imagining it. I spent a month running speed tests every single hour to figure out exactly what's happening during those "peak hours" everyone complains about.</p>

        <p>Turns out, there's actually a lot going on. And some of it you can fix, some of it you can't.</p>

        <h2>The Data: A Month of Hourly Speed Tests</h2>

        <p>I set up an automated script to run speed tests every hour for 30 days straight. Here's what I found (on my 300 Mbps cable plan):</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 AM - 7 AM:</strong> Average 290 Mbps (97% of advertised speed)</li>
            <li><strong>7 AM - 9 AM:</strong> Average 265 Mbps (88%)</li>
            <li><strong>9 AM - 5 PM:</strong> Average 275 Mbps (92%)</li>
            <li><strong>5 PM - 7 PM:</strong> Average 220 Mbps (73%)</li>
            <li><strong>7 PM - 11 PM:</strong> Average 185 Mbps (62%) <-- Yikes</li>
            <li><strong>11 PM - 2 AM:</strong> Average 255 Mbps (85%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So yeah, between 7-11 PM, I was consistently losing about 35-40% of my speed. That's not a small drop.</p>

        <h2>Why This Happens (It's Not Always Your ISP Being Evil)</h2>

        <p>There are actually three different things causing this, and they're all happening at once:</p>

        <h3>1. Neighborhood Congestion</h3>

        <p>Cable internet works by sharing bandwidth with your neighbors. Think of it like a highway - at 3 AM, you've got the whole road to yourself. At 7 PM when everyone's home streaming Netflix? You're in rush hour traffic.</p>

        <p>This is especially bad in apartment buildings or dense neighborhoods. My building has probably 150 units, and I'd bet at least 100 of them are streaming something between 7-9 PM.</p>

        <h3>2. ISP Network Congestion</h3>

        <p>Even if your local node isn't overloaded, the ISP's backbone network might be. This is the part where all the neighborhoods connect to the bigger internet. During peak hours, these connections can get saturated too.</p>

        <p>This is why sometimes <em>everyone</em> in your city experiences slowdowns at the same time - it's not just your neighborhood.</p>

        <h3>3. The Websites You're Visiting Are Slower</h3>

        <p>Plot twist: sometimes it's not even your connection. Popular streaming sites, social media, even YouTube can get slower during peak hours because they're serving millions of people simultaneously.</p>

        <p>I noticed this especially with certain streaming platforms - the speed test would show 200 Mbps, but the stream would still buffer because the server couldn't keep up.</p>

        <h2>What Actually Helps (And What Doesn't)</h2>

        <p>Okay, so here's what I tried over the past few months:</p>

        <h3>Things That Helped:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upgrading my router:</strong> My old router was bottlenecking during high-traffic times. A newer router with better processing power actually made a noticeable difference. Went from 185 Mbps to 215 Mbps during peak hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Using ethernet instead of WiFi:</strong> WiFi gets even more congested during peak hours (everyone's WiFi is interfering with each other). Wired connection was consistently 30-40 Mbps faster.</li>
            <li><strong>QoS settings on my router:</strong> Set up Quality of Service to prioritize video calls over streaming. Made work calls way more stable even when speeds dropped.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Things That Didn't Help:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complaining to my ISP:</strong> They ran a test (during off-peak hours, of course), said everything looked fine, and basically told me "network congestion is normal." Thanks, super helpful.</li>
            <li><strong>Changing DNS servers:</strong> Saw this advice everywhere. Switched to Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS, etc. Zero difference during peak hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Those "internet speed booster" software tools:</strong> Don't waste your money. They do literally nothing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do Those "Priority" or "Gamer" Plans Actually Work?</h2>

        <p>This one surprised me. My ISP offers a "Priority Internet" upgrade for an extra $20/month that supposedly gives you "priority bandwidth during peak hours."</p>

        <p>I tried it for a month. The results were... meh.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Peak hour speeds improved from ~185 Mbps to ~210 Mbps</li>
            <li>Still nowhere near the advertised 300 Mbps</li>
            <li>Latency was slightly better (30ms vs 25ms)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So it helped a little, but not $20/month worth of help. Your mileage may vary depending on how oversold your ISP's network is.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Pro tip:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Before paying extra for a "priority" plan, try upgrading to a higher speed tier first. Sometimes the regular 500 Mbps plan performs better during peak hours than the 300 Mbps "priority" plan, because you're working with more headroom when congestion hits.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Real Solution? Better Infrastructure or Fiber</h2>

        <p>Here's the hard truth: if you're on cable internet in a crowded area, peak hour slowdowns are just part of the deal. The technology fundamentally requires sharing bandwidth with neighbors.</p>

        <p>The only real solutions are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Switch to fiber if available:</strong> Fiber connections are typically dedicated lines, not shared. My friend on fiber gets 480-495 Mbps regardless of time of day.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade to a much higher tier:</strong> If you've got 300 Mbps and it drops to 180 during peak hours, upgrading to 600 Mbps means you'd still get 350+ when it's congested.</li>
            <li><strong>Move to a less dense area:</strong> Okay this one's not exactly practical, but rural/suburban cable internet genuinely has less congestion than urban apartments.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What I'm Doing About It</h2>

        <p>After all this testing, here's my current setup:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Upgraded my router (helped a bit)</li>
            <li>Ethernet to my desk for work calls</li>
            <li>QoS settings prioritizing video conferencing</li>
            <li>Schedule big downloads for overnight</li>
            <li>Waiting for fiber to come to my building (they keep saying "next year"...)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It's not perfect, but I've adapted. The 7-9 PM period still sucks, but at least I understand why now.</p>

        <h2>TL;DR</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Evening slowdowns are real and mostly caused by network congestion</li>
            <li>You're sharing bandwidth with your neighbors on cable internet</li>
            <li>Better router and ethernet help, but don't solve the underlying problem</li>
            <li>"Priority" plans help marginally but probably aren't worth the extra cost</li>
            <li>Fiber internet doesn't have this problem (if it's available in your area)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're stuck with cable like me, just know you're not alone. We're all suffering through 7 PM Netflix traffic together.</p>
