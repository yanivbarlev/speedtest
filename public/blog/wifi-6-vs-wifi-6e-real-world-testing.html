        <h1>WiFi 6 vs WiFi 6E: I Tested Both and Here's What Surprised Me</h1>
        <div class="blog-meta">December 28, 2024 • 6 min read</div>

        <p>So I finally caved and bought a WiFi 6E router last month after seeing everyone rave about the "exclusive 6GHz band" that's supposedly game-changing. Spoiler alert: it's complicated.</p>

        <p>I spent two weeks running side-by-side comparisons with my existing WiFi 6 router, and the results were... not what I expected. Here's the honest breakdown.</p>

        <h2>The Test Setup</h2>

        <p>First, the boring details. I tested both routers in my 1800 sq ft apartment:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>WiFi 6 Router:</strong> TP-Link Archer AX73 ($150)</li>
            <li><strong>WiFi 6E Router:</strong> ASUS RT-AXE7800 ($300)</li>
            <li><strong>Internet:</strong> 500 Mbps fiber connection</li>
            <li><strong>Test Devices:</strong> iPhone 15 Pro (6E compatible), MacBook Pro M2 (6E), older iPad (WiFi 6 only)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I ran speed tests from different rooms, at different times, with different devices. Probably way more than necessary, but hey, you're getting good data out of it.</p>

        <h2>The 6GHz Band: Amazing When It Works</h2>

        <p>Okay, so here's where WiFi 6E shines. When I'm in the same room as the router on the 6GHz band, the speeds are insane:</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Location</th>
                <th>WiFi 6 (5GHz)</th>
                <th>WiFi 6E (6GHz)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Same room (10 ft)</td>
                <td>420 Mbps</td>
                <td>490 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>One room away</td>
                <td>380 Mbps</td>
                <td>450 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Two rooms away</td>
                <td>280 Mbps</td>
                <td>310 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Opposite end of apartment</td>
                <td>180 Mbps</td>
                <td>85 Mbps (!)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>See that last line? That's the problem with 6GHz - <strong>it doesn't penetrate walls well at all</strong>.</p>

        <h2>The Range Problem Nobody Talks About</h2>

        <p>This is what surprised me most. The 6GHz band is incredible for speed, but terrible for range. In my bedroom (opposite end from the router, through 2 walls), the 6GHz connection would either:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Drop completely and fall back to 5GHz</li>
            <li>Connect but give me slower speeds than regular 5GHz</li>
            <li>Work fine but randomly disconnect</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Meanwhile, the regular 5GHz band on both routers? Rock solid, even in that back bedroom.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>The reality check:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you live in a small apartment or your router is centrally located, 6GHz is great. If you have a bigger place or your router's in a corner (like most people), you're probably going to be on 5GHz most of the time anyway.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Latency and Gaming</h2>

        <p>This is where I expected big improvements but didn't really see them. Gaming ping on WiFi 6E was marginally better:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>WiFi 6 (5GHz): 12-15ms</li>
            <li>WiFi 6E (6GHz): 10-12ms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That 2-3ms difference? I honestly couldn't feel it in gameplay. Maybe pro esports players would notice, but for regular gaming, it's not a game-changer.</p>

        <h2>The Congestion Advantage (This One's Real)</h2>

        <p>Here's where WiFi 6E actually delivers on its promises. I live in an apartment building with like 30 other WiFi networks visible from my place. The 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands are absolutely crowded.</p>

        <p>The 6GHz band? Completely empty. No other networks. And you can really feel the difference during peak hours (evenings/weekends when everyone's home).</p>

        <p>On regular WiFi 6, my speeds would drop from 400 Mbps to about 300 Mbps around 8 PM. On WiFi 6E's 6GHz band (when connected), they stayed at 480 Mbps consistently.</p>

        <p>So if you live in a densely populated area with tons of WiFi interference, this alone might justify the upgrade.</p>

        <h2>Device Compatibility is Still Limited</h2>

        <p>Here's the annoying part - most of your devices probably don't support 6GHz yet. Out of all the devices in my apartment:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>iPhone 15 Pro - YES (6GHz works)</li>
            <li>MacBook Pro M2 - YES (6GHz works)</li>
            <li>2021 iPad Pro - NO (WiFi 6 only)</li>
            <li>Smart TV - NO (WiFi 5 only)</li>
            <li>PS5 - NO (WiFi 6 only)</li>
            <li>Various smart home devices - NO</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So out of like 15 connected devices, only 2 could actually use the 6GHz band. The rest were using the same 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands they always have.</p>

        <h2>Is WiFi 6E Worth the Extra Cost?</h2>

        <p>Okay, real talk time. WiFi 6E routers cost about $100-150 more than equivalent WiFi 6 models. Is it worth it?</p>

        <p><strong>Get WiFi 6E if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You live in a crowded apartment/condo with tons of WiFi networks nearby</li>
            <li>You have multiple WiFi 6E devices already (or plan to upgrade soon)</li>
            <li>Your router is centrally located or you have a smaller home</li>
            <li>You're futureproofing and plan to keep the router for 4-5 years</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Stick with WiFi 6 if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You live in a house with minimal WiFi congestion</li>
            <li>Most of your devices are older and don't support 6GHz</li>
            <li>Your router needs to cover a large area or penetrate multiple walls</li>
            <li>You're on a budget and $150 matters</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Verdict</h2>

        <p>After two weeks of testing, I'm keeping the WiFi 6E router. But not for the reasons I thought I would.</p>

        <p>The 6GHz band is nice when I'm working in my office (near the router), but 90% of the time, my devices are on the 5GHz band anyway. The real value for me is having less congestion during peak hours and knowing I'm ready for future devices.</p>

        <p>But if I lived in a house instead of an apartment, or if I was on a tighter budget? I'd save the money and get a really good WiFi 6 router instead. The performance difference isn't dramatic enough to justify the premium unless you have specific needs.</p>

        <p>Bottom line: WiFi 6E is better, but it's not <em>that</em> much better for most people right now. Maybe in 2-3 years when more devices support it, it'll be a no-brainer. Today? It's a "nice to have" not a "must have."</p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Curious about your WiFi speeds?</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="../index.html" style="color: #00d4ff;">Test your connection</a> and see if you're getting the speeds you should be. Try testing from different rooms to see where your WiFi signal is weakest.</p>
