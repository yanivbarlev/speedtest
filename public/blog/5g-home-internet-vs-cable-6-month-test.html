        <h1>I Replaced My Cable Internet with 5G Home Internet for 6 Months - Here's How It Went</h1>
        <div class="blog-meta">November 29, 2024 • 8 min read</div>

        <p>After seeing T-Mobile's 5G home internet ads everywhere promising "no data caps, no contracts, just $50/month," I finally pulled the trigger in May. After six months of daily use, I've got a lot to say about when 5G home internet is awesome and when it's... not.</p>

        <p>Fair warning: this is going to be a long one because there's alot of nuance here.</p>

        <h2>Why I Switched (Spoiler: I Hate Comcast)</h2>

        <p>I was paying Comcast $85/month for 300 Mbps internet that regularly dropped to 150 Mbps during peak hours. Plus they'd raised my rate three times in two years, and customer service was a nightmare.</p>

        <p>T-Mobile's pitch was simple: $50/month, no installation, no contract, no data caps. If it sucked, I could just return the gateway and cancel. Worth a shot, right?</p>

        <h2>The First Week: Unrealistically Good</h2>

        <p>The gateway arrived, I plugged it in, and within 5 minutes I was connected. No tech visit, no drilling holes, no 4-hour installation window. Already better than cable.</p>

        <p>Initial speed tests were incredible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download: 380-450 Mbps</li>
            <li>Upload: 45-65 Mbps</li>
            <li>Ping: 25-35ms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I was thrilled. Faster than my cable, half the price, no Comcast. This was going to be great!</p>

        <p>...Then reality set in.</p>

        <h2>Month 1-2: The Honeymoon Ends</h2>

        <p>About two weeks in, I started noticing patterns. The speeds were all over the place depending on time of day:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early morning (5-9 AM):</strong> 400+ Mbps - fantastic</li>
            <li><strong>Midday (9 AM-5 PM):</strong> 250-350 Mbps - pretty good</li>
            <li><strong>Evening (5-10 PM):</strong> 80-180 Mbps - ugh</li>
            <li><strong>Late night (10 PM-1 AM):</strong> 300-400 Mbps - back to great</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So during the hours when I actually <em>use</em> the internet most (evenings), I was getting the worst speeds. Classic.</p>

        <p>Also discovered that the connection would randomly drop for 30-60 seconds a few times a day. Not often enough to be unusable, but often enough to be annoying during video calls.</p>

        <h2>Month 3: Gateway Placement is Everything</h2>

        <p>After complaining on Reddit, someone suggested I try moving the gateway around to find better signal. This turned into a whole thing.</p>

        <p>I walked around my apartment with the gateway checking signal strength on the admin page. Found out:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Near my north-facing window: 3 bars, "Very Good" signal</li>
            <li>Near my east-facing window: 4 bars, "Excellent" signal</li>
            <li>In the living room where I initially had it: 2 bars, "Good" signal</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Moving it to that east window made a huge difference:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Evening speeds improved from 80-180 Mbps to 150-250 Mbps</li>
            <li>Random disconnects went from 3-4/day to maybe 1/day</li>
            <li>Overall more consistent</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Pro tip:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you try 5G home internet, spend your first week moving the gateway around and testing different locations. The difference between 2 bars and 4 bars is massive. Even a few feet can matter.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Month 4: Weather is a Factor (Wait, What?)</h2>

        <p>This one caught me off guard. During a week of heavy storms in August, my speeds tanked. We're talking 40-80 Mbps when it was raining hard.</p>

        <p>Turns out 5G signals can be affected by weather - especially heavy rain. It's not a huge problem, but it's definitely a thing that cable internet doesn't have to deal with.</p>

        <p>Also noticed slower speeds on super hot days (95°F+). Not sure if that's the tower getting congested because everyone's running AC, or if heat affects the signal, but it was noticeable.</p>

        <h2>Month 5-6: I've Adapted, But There Are Tradeoffs</h2>

        <p>By this point, I'd learned to work around the limitations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Schedule big downloads for morning or late night</li>
            <li>Keep my old cable connection info in case I need to switch back (I haven't)</li>
            <li>Have my phone hotspot ready as backup for important video calls</li>
            <li>Accept that evening speeds will be slower</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The question became: are these workarounds worth the $35/month savings?</p>

        <h2>The Good: What I Love About 5G Home Internet</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Price:</strong> $50/month vs $85/month for cable. That's $420/year saved.</li>
            <li><strong>No contract:</strong> I can cancel anytime if it stops working well</li>
            <li><strong>No data caps:</strong> I've used 2+ TB some months with zero issues</li>
            <li><strong>Upload speeds:</strong> 50-60 Mbps vs 10 Mbps with cable. Huge difference for video calls.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple setup:</strong> Literally plug it in and you're done</li>
            <li><strong>No dealing with Comcast:</strong> This alone might be worth the tradeoffs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bad: What Drives Me Crazy</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Evening congestion:</strong> Speeds drop significantly when everyone's home</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Never know exactly what speeds I'll get</li>
            <li><strong>Random dropouts:</strong> Brief disconnections still happen occasionally</li>
            <li><strong>Weather sensitivity:</strong> Performance degrades during storms</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming ping:</strong> 25-45ms vs 15-20ms on cable. Noticeable in competitive games.</li>
            <li><strong>Can't hardwire everything:</strong> Gateway only has 2 ethernet ports</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When 5G Home Internet Makes Sense</h2>

        <p>After 6 months, here's my honest take on who should consider it:</p>

        <p><strong>5G home internet is great if you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Live in an area with good T-Mobile/Verizon 5G coverage</li>
            <li>Hate your cable company (valid)</li>
            <li>Want to save money on internet</li>
            <li>Don't do competitive online gaming</li>
            <li>Can be flexible about when you do bandwidth-heavy stuff</li>
            <li>Need internet RIGHT NOW and can't wait for installation</li>
            <li>Rent and might move soon (no contract to deal with)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Stick with cable/fiber if you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work from home with constant video calls</li>
            <li>Do competitive gaming where ping matters</li>
            <li>Need 100% reliable, consistent speeds</li>
            <li>Have fiber available (fiber is still king)</li>
            <li>Have a good cable plan that actually delivers advertised speeds</li>
            <li>Live in an area with weak 5G signal</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Important:</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Before committing to 5G home internet, check if there's a trial period. T-Mobile and Verizon both offer returns within 14-15 days. Use that time to really test it - different times of day, different weather, etc. Don't just test it once and assume it'll always work that well.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Verdict: Am I Keeping It?</h2>

        <p>Yes, but with caveats.</p>

        <p>For my situation (working from home but flexible hours, living alone, not a competitive gamer), the savings and simplicity outweigh the inconsistency. I've saved over $200 so far, and I haven't had any show-stopping issues.</p>

        <p>Would I recommend it to my parents? No - they need something that just works consistently without thinking about it.</p>

        <p>Would I recommend it to my gamer friend? No - the ping variability would drive him nuts.</p>

        <p>Would I recommend it to someone paying $100+/month for cable internet? Yeah, worth trying at least.</p>

        <h2>Tips If You Decide to Try It</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Test placement thoroughly:</strong> Spend the first week finding the optimal spot for the gateway. Near a window is usually best.</li>
            <li><strong>Check signal strength:</strong> Log into the gateway admin page and check your signal metrics. Aim for 3+ bars.</li>
            <li><strong>Test at different times:</strong> Run speed tests throughout the day to see the variability.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep backup internet:</strong> Don't cancel cable until you're sure 5G works for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Buy your own mesh system:</strong> The built-in WiFi on these gateways is mediocre. I'm using it with my own mesh WiFi system.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor data usage:</strong> Even though it's "unlimited," I've heard stories of throttling after like 1TB. Hasn't happened to me yet.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>5G home internet isn't perfect, but it's gotten way better than when it first launched. For the right situation, it's a genuine alternative to cable.</p>

        <p>The key is understanding what you're getting into - it's not as consistent as wired internet, but it's also half the price with no contract. That trade-off works for some people (like me) and doesn't work for others.</p>

        <p>If you're on the fence, I'd say try it. Worst case scenario, you return it and go back to cable. Best case, you save a bunch of money and escape your cable company.</p>

        <p>Just... don't expect miracles. It's good internet at a great price, not perfect internet.</p>
