        <h1>I Tested 4 Popular Mesh WiFi Systems - Here's What Actually Worked</h1>
        <div class="blog-meta">December 5, 2024 • 7 min read</div>

        <p>So I moved into a three-story townhouse with concrete walls last September, and my trusty old Netgear router couldn't handle it. Dead zones everywhere - the upstairs bedrooms had basically no signal, and don't even get me started on the basement.</p>

        <p>After weeks of research paralysis, I decided to just buy four different mesh systems and test them all. Returned the ones I didn't like. Here's what I found.</p>

        <h2>The House Layout (Context Matters)</h2>

        <p>Before we get into the systems, here's what I'm working with:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1950s townhouse, 2200 sq ft across 3 floors</li>
            <li>Concrete walls between units (shares walls with neighbors)</li>
            <li>Router has to go in basement where cable comes in (not ideal)</li>
            <li>500 Mbps fiber internet</li>
            <li>Usually 15-20 devices connected</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have a normal house with the router centrally located, your results will probably be better than mine. My setup was basically worst-case scenario.</p>

        <h2>The Systems I Tested</h2>

        <h3>1. Google Nest WiFi Pro (WiFi 6E) - $400 for 3-pack</h3>

        <p>I'll be honest - I bought this one first because it looked nice and the app screenshots were pretty. That's terrible reasoning but here we are.</p>

        <div class="pros-cons">
            <div class="pros">
                <h4>What I Liked:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Setup was ridiculously easy</li>
                    <li>App is actually good</li>
                    <li>Looks nice (if that matters to you)</li>
                    <li>6GHz support is future-proof</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="cons">
                <h4>What I Didn't:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Only 2 ethernet ports per unit</li>
                    <li>Can't customize much</li>
                    <li>Expensive for what you get</li>
                    <li>Third floor still had dead spots</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Speed Results:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basement (main unit): 485 Mbps</li>
            <li>First floor: 420 Mbps</li>
            <li>Second floor: 340 Mbps</li>
            <li>Third floor: 180 Mbps (not great)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Google system worked okay, but for $400, I expected better third-floor coverage. The app is great though - definitely the most user-friendly of everything I tested.</p>

        <h3>2. TP-Link Deco XE75 (WiFi 6E) - $300 for 3-pack</h3>

        <p>This one surprised me. It's cheaper than the Google system but performed better in most areas.</p>

        <div class="pros-cons">
            <div class="pros">
                <h4>What I Liked:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Best overall coverage I tested</li>
                    <li>Three ethernet ports per unit</li>
                    <li>Good parental controls</li>
                    <li>$100 cheaper than Google</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="cons">
                <h4>What I Didn't:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>App is... functional but ugly</li>
                    <li>Units are kinda bulky</li>
                    <li>Setup took longer</li>
                    <li>Random disconnects first week (firmware update fixed it)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Speed Results:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basement (main unit): 490 Mbps</li>
            <li>First floor: 450 Mbps</li>
            <li>Second floor: 390 Mbps</li>
            <li>Third floor: 280 Mbps (much better!)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is the one I kept. The coverage was noticeably better than Google's system, especially on the third floor. Yeah, the app isn't as pretty, but I don't look at it that often anyway.</p>

        <h3>3. Amazon eero Pro 6E - $450 for 3-pack</h3>

        <p>The most expensive one I tested. Amazon really wants $450 for this?</p>

        <div class="pros-cons">
            <div class="pros">
                <h4>What I Liked:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Integrates with Alexa nicely</li>
                    <li>Small and discreet</li>
                    <li>Solid performance</li>
                    <li>Automatic updates</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="cons">
                <h4>What I Didn't:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Most expensive option</li>
                    <li>Only 2 ethernet ports</li>
                    <li>Some features require subscription</li>
                    <li>Not as configurable as others</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Speed Results:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basement (main unit): 480 Mbps</li>
            <li>First floor: 430 Mbps</li>
            <li>Second floor: 370 Mbps</li>
            <li>Third floor: 240 Mbps</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It's good, but not $450 good. The Alexa integration is nice if you're deep in the Amazon ecosystem, but otherwise I don't see why you'd pay the premium over the TP-Link system.</p>

        <h3>4. ASUS ZenWiFi XT8 (WiFi 6) - $350 for 2-pack</h3>

        <p>This one's different - only 2 units for $350, but they're more powerful than the others.</p>

        <div class="pros-cons">
            <div class="pros">
                <h4>What I Liked:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Most customization options</li>
                    <li>Best for gamers (low latency)</li>
                    <li>4 ethernet ports per unit</li>
                    <li>Solid build quality</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="cons">
                <h4>What I Didn't:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Huge - looks like alien spacecraft</li>
                    <li>Setup more complicated</li>
                    <li>Only 2 units (had to buy third separately)</li>
                    <li>Not WiFi 6E</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Speed Results:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basement (main unit): 475 Mbps</li>
            <li>First floor: 440 Mbps</li>
            <li>Second floor: 360 Mbps</li>
            <li>Third floor: needed a third unit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're a power user who wants to tweak everything, this is probably your system. But for me, it was overkill and the units were too big to place discretely.</p>

        <h2>Key Lessons Learned</h2>

        <h3>1. Unit Placement Matters Way More Than I Thought</h3>

        <p>I initially just plugged units in wherever there was an outlet. Bad idea. After watching a bunch of YouTube videos, I learned you should place them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In open areas, not inside cabinets (seems obvious now)</li>
            <li>Roughly equidistant from each other</li>
            <li>At different heights on different floors</li>
            <li>Away from other electronics that cause interference</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Just moving the units to better spots improved my speeds by like 50 Mbps on the third floor.</p>

        <h3>2. You Might Need More Units Than the Package Suggests</h3>

        <p>All these systems claim "covers up to 6000 sq ft!" Yeah, maybe if you live in an open loft with no walls. In a real house with doors and walls? Divide that number by 2.</p>

        <p>For my 2200 sq ft place with challenging layout, three units was barely enough. I'm considering adding a fourth for the garage.</p>

        <h3>3. Wired Backhaul Makes a Huge Difference</h3>

        <p>If you can run ethernet cables between your mesh units (called "wired backhaul"), do it. I ran one cable from basement to second floor, and the speeds on that floor jumped from 340 Mbps to 460 Mbps.</p>

        <p>Problem is, running cables through walls sucks. So I only did it for one unit.</p>

        <h3>4. The App Quality Actually Matters</h3>

        <p>I thought "meh, I'll set it up once and forget about it." Wrong. You end up opening the app way more than you'd expect - troubleshooting issues, checking which devices are connected, updating firmware, etc.</p>

        <p>Google's app is the best, TP-Link's is functional but meh, ASUS's is powerful but confusing.</p>

        <h2>Which One Should You Buy?</h2>

        <p><strong>Best Overall Value:</strong> TP-Link Deco XE75 ($300)</p>
        <p>Best coverage, good price, WiFi 6E. The app isn't pretty but who cares - it works.</p>

        <p><strong>Best for Easy Setup:</strong> Google Nest WiFi Pro ($400)</p>
        <p>If you value simplicity over everything else and don't mind paying extra.</p>

        <p><strong>Best for Power Users:</strong> ASUS ZenWiFi XT8 ($350)</p>
        <p>If you want tons of customization and ethernet ports.</p>

        <p><strong>Skip:</strong> Amazon eero Pro 6E ($450)</p>
        <p>It's good, but you're paying a premium for the Amazon brand. Not worth it unless you really want Alexa integration.</p>

        <h2>My Final Setup</h2>

        <p>I kept the TP-Link Deco XE75 system. After optimizing placement and adding wired backhaul to one unit, here's my current speeds throughout the house:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basement: 490 Mbps</li>
            <li>First floor: 465 Mbps</li>
            <li>Second floor: 470 Mbps (wired backhaul)</li>
            <li>Third floor: 310 Mbps</li>
        </ul>

        <p>No more dead zones, and everyone's happy. Video calls don't drop, 4K streaming works everywhere, and gaming ping is stable.</p>

        <p>Was it worth the hassle of testing four different systems? Honestly, probably not - the TP-Link and Google systems were pretty close in performance. But at least now you don't have to do the same thing.</p>
