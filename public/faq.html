        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How accurate is this speed test?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Our speed test is designed to be as accurate as possible, but results can vary based on many factors including network congestion, server location, your device performance, and WiFi interference. For best results, we recommend running multiple tests at different times of day and using a wired Ethernet connection when possible.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why do I get different results each time?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Internet speeds fluctuate constantly due to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Network congestion (more users online during peak hours)</li>
                    <li>ISP network conditions</li>
                    <li>Server load at the time of testing</li>
                    <li>Background applications using bandwidth</li>
                    <li>WiFi interference from nearby networks or devices</li>
                </ul>
                This is normal. Run several tests and look at the average to get a better picture of your connection speed.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is download speed and why does it matter?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Download speed measures how fast data travels from the internet to your device, measured in Mbps (Megabits per second). This affects how quickly web pages load, videos stream, and files download. Higher is better. Most activities like browsing and streaming rely heavily on download speed.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is upload speed and why does it matter?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Upload speed measures how fast data travels from your device to the internet. This is important for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Video calls and conferencing</li>
                    <li>Uploading files to cloud storage</li>
                    <li>Live streaming</li>
                    <li>Sending emails with attachments</li>
                    <li>Online gaming (sending player actions)</li>
                </ul>
                Upload speed is typically lower than download speed on most residential internet connections.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is ping (latency) and why does it matter?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Ping measures how long it takes for data to travel to a server and back, measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower is better. Ping is crucial for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Online gaming (affects responsiveness)</li>
                    <li>Video conferencing (affects lag)</li>
                    <li>VoIP calls</li>
                    <li>Real-time applications</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Ping ratings:</strong> Under 20ms = Excellent, 20-50ms = Good, 50-100ms = Average, 100ms+ = Poor for gaming
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What internet speed do I need?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                It depends on your usage:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1-5 Mbps:</strong> Email, web browsing, standard definition streaming</li>
                    <li><strong>5-25 Mbps:</strong> HD video streaming, video calls, light online gaming</li>
                    <li><strong>25-100 Mbps:</strong> Multiple HD streams, gaming, large downloads</li>
                    <li><strong>100+ Mbps:</strong> 4K streaming, multiple heavy users, smart home devices</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why is my speed slower than what I'm paying for?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>WiFi vs Ethernet:</strong> WiFi is almost always slower than wired connections</li>
                    <li><strong>Peak hours:</strong> Slower during evenings when more people are online</li>
                    <li><strong>ISP throttling:</strong> Some ISPs limit speeds during certain times or activities</li>
                    <li><strong>Old equipment:</strong> Outdated routers or modems can bottleneck speeds</li>
                    <li><strong>"Up to" speeds:</strong> ISPs advertise maximum speeds, not guaranteed speeds</li>
                    <li><strong>Network congestion:</strong> Too many devices using the connection simultaneously</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between Multi and Single connection mode?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <strong>Multi Connection Mode:</strong> Tests using multiple parallel connections simultaneously. This better represents real-world usage where multiple streams of data are often transferred at once (like loading a webpage with many images).
                <br><br>
                <strong>Single Connection Mode:</strong> Tests using one connection at a time. This can be useful for troubleshooting or testing specific scenarios.
                <br><br>
                Most users should use Multi mode for more realistic results.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Does the speed test use my data?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes, running a speed test uses a small amount of your data allowance (if you have one). A typical test uses 10-100 MB depending on your connection speed. If you're on a limited mobile data plan, be aware that running frequent tests could consume your data allowance.
            </div>

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Where is my test history stored?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Your test history is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. This means:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data stays on your device, not on our servers</li>
                    <li>History is private and not shared</li>
                    <li>Clearing browser data will delete your history</li>
                    <li>History doesn't sync between devices or browsers</li>
                    <li>You can clear it anytime using the "Clear History" button</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is this speed test free?</div>

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I use these results to dispute my ISP bill?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                While our speed test results can be useful evidence when discussing service quality with your ISP, we recommend:
                <ul>
                    <li>Running multiple tests over several days at different times</li>
                    <li>Taking screenshots of consistent slow results</li>
                    <li>Using multiple speed test services for comparison</li>
                    <li>Testing with a wired connection for most accurate results</li>
                </ul>
                Keep in mind that ISPs typically advertise "up to" speeds, not guaranteed speeds, so some variation is normal.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why should I test at different times of day?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Internet speeds vary throughout the day because:
                <ul>
                    <li>Peak hours (evening 6-11pm) = More users online = Slower speeds</li>
                    <li>Off-peak hours (late night/early morning) = Fewer users = Faster speeds</li>
                    <li>Business hours may show different patterns depending on your neighborhood</li>
                </ul>
                Testing at different times gives you a complete picture of your connection's performance.
