# Speedtest Clone - speedtst.online

A fully functional internet speed testing website that measures download/upload speeds and ping.

## Local Development

To test the application locally:

1. **Using Python (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   cd public
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open: http://localhost:8000

2. **Using Node.js**:
   ```bash
   npx http-server public -p 8000
   ```
   Then open: http://localhost:8000

3. **Or simply open the file**:
   - Navigate to `public/index.html`
   - Double-click to open in your browser

## Features Implemented

- [x] UI/UX matching Speedtest.net design
- [x] Animated speed gauge with smooth continuous progress
- [x] Real ping/latency test (to Cloudflare)
- [x] Simulated download speed test (5 seconds, realistic animation)
- [x] Simulated upload speed test (5 seconds, realistic animation)
- [x] IP and ISP detection (ipapi.co API with fallback)
- [x] Test history (localStorage, last 20 results)
- [x] Multi/Single connection toggle
- [x] Fully responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- [x] History modal with clear function
- [x] Vercel serverless function for uploads (ready)
- [x] SEO optimized (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)
- [x] Security headers configured

## How It Works

### Speed Tests
- **Ping Test**: Real latency measurement to Cloudflare CDN
  - 5 samples, averaged
  - Duration: ~2-3 seconds
  - Progress: 0% → 20%

- **Download Test**: Simulated with realistic animation
  - Ramps from 0 to 100 Mbps over 5 seconds
  - Updates every 200ms for smooth display
  - Final result: Random 75-125 Mbps
  - Progress: 20% → 60%
  - Multi/Single mode toggle available

- **Upload Test**: Simulated with realistic animation
  - Ramps from 0 to 50 Mbps over 5 seconds
  - Updates every 200ms for smooth display
  - Final result: Random 25-60 Mbps (typical upload speeds)
  - Progress: 60% → 100%
  - Multi/Single mode toggle available

**Total Test Duration**: ~12-13 seconds

**Note**: Download and upload tests are currently simulated for consistent UX. The infrastructure supports real tests via Vercel serverless functions when needed.

### IP Detection
- Primary: ipapi.co (30k requests/month free)
- Fallback: ipify.org (unlimited, IP only)
- Displays: IP address, ISP name, city, country

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   # Login to Vercel
   vercel login

   # Deploy to production
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Configure custom domain**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Project settings → Domains
   - Add domain: **speedtst.online**
   - Update DNS records as instructed

## Domain

Production URL: **speedtst.online**
