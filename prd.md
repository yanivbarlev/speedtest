- Ensure all policies are in place
- Add contact form and about information
- Wait 6+ months if site is brand new domain

### Risk 2: Inaccurate Speed Tests
**Mitigation**:
- Use established speed test libraries
- Test against multiple reference sources
- Implement proper error handling
- Use CDN-hosted test files

### Risk 3: High Server Costs
**Mitigation**:
- Use static hosting for main site
- Leverage existing CDNs for test files
- Implement rate limiting
- Consider P2P testing methods

### Risk 4: Browser Compatibility Issues
**Mitigation**:
- Test on all major browsers early
- Use feature detection, not browser detection
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- User accounts and registration
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- VPN detection
- Speed test history charts/graphs
- Social sharing with custom images
- API for third-party integration
- White-label solution
- Advanced network diagnostics
- ISP comparison tools
- Email notifications for slow speeds

## Constraints
- Must be completed within 4-5 weeks
- Budget: Minimal (free hosting tier)
- No backend database initially (use localStorage)
- Must comply with all AdSense policies
- Mobile-first design approach mandatory
